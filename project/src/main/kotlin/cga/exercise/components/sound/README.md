# SOUNDS

This package provides logik and wrapper classes for all the sound systems in the game.
For that it uses openal, a opengl equivalent of sounds.
Openal removes the annoying hardwarelogik and provides features, such as the doppler effect, and relative sound.

This code currently is mostly copy pasted from the
[3d game development with lwjgl book](https://lwjglgamedev.gitbooks.io/3d-game-development-with-lwjgl/content/chapter22/chapter22.html).

# IMPORTANT

- relative sound **only** works with Mono-channels
